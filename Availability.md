Focuses on building systems that stay operational and accessible, minimizing downtime through strategies like **redundancy, load balancing, and failover** to ensure continuous service.

| 99.99% (four nines) | 52.6 minutes | E-commerce |
| 99.999% (five nines) | 5.26 minutes | Banking, Healthcare |
