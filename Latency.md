### L — Latency
> **Is it fast enough for users?**

Latency is the time taken for a request to travel from client to server and back.

| Latency | User Perception | Example |
|---------|-----------------|---------|
| < 100ms | Instant | Google Search |
| 100-300ms | Slight delay | E-commerce checkout |
| 300ms-1s | Noticeable | Acceptable for complex queries |
| > 1s | Frustrating | Users start leaving |

**Amazon's Discovery:** Every 100ms of latency costs 1% in sales.

**Interview Question:** *"How would you reduce latency in this system?"*
